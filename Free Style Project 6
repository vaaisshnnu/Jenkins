Example:

   https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ===================================================

3. Leave credentials empty (since it’s a public repo).
4. You can leave the branch as `*/main` or `*/master` depending on your repo.

1. Scroll to Build section.
2. Click “Add build step” → "Execute shell”.
