Concept Example : You want to create a Jenkins Freestyle Project to create a shell file from Jenkins dashboard in my EC2 and to create a file with it's output.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to create a **Jenkins Freestyle Project** that-

1. **Creates a shell script file** on your EC2 instance.
2. **Executes the script**.
3. **Saves the output** to a separate file.

---

### ✅ **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are ready:
- Jenkins is installed and running on your EC2 instance.
- Jenkins has permission to write to the desired directory.
- Jenkins has access to a shell (Linux environment).

---

### 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Jenkins Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Access Jenkins**
- Open your browser: `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080`
- Login with your Jenkins credentials.

---

#### **Step 2: Create a New Freestyle Project**
1. Click **“New Item”**.
2. Enter a name like: `CreateAndRunShellScript`.
3. Select **“Freestyle project”**.
4. Click **OK**.

---

#### **Step 3: Configure the Project**

##### **General Section**
- Add a description (optional):  
  _“This job creates a shell script, runs it, and saves the output to a file.”_

---

##### **Build Section**
1. Click **“Add build step”** → **“Execute shell”**.
2. Paste the following shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define paths
SCRIPT_PATH="/home/ec2-user/generated_script.sh"
OUTPUT_PATH="/home/ec2-user/script_output.txt"

# Create the shell script
cat << 'EOF' > $SCRIPT_PATH
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script started at: $(date)"
echo "Running system info..."
uname -a
df -h
echo "Script completed at: $(date)"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x $SCRIPT_PATH

# Run the script and save output
$SCRIPT_PATH > $OUTPUT_PATH 2>&1
```

> 🔐 Make sure `/home/ec2-user/` is writable by Jenkins. You can change the path if needed.

---

#### **Step 4: Save and Build**
- Click **“Save”**.
- Click **“Build Now”** to run the job.
- Click on the build number → **Console Output** to verify success.

---

#### **Step 5: Verify Output on EC2**
SSH into your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
cat /home/ec2-user/script_output.txt
```

You should see the output of the script execution.

Would you like to **parameterize** the script (e.g., let users input the filename or commands)? I can guide you through that next!
