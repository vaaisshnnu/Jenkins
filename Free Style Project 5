You want to create a Jenkins Freestyle Project with throttling enabled (i.e., limiting the number of concurrent builds or builds per time period), you can use the Throttle Concurrent Builds Plugin.

# Here’s a step-by-step guide** to set up a project called Throttle build

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Install the Plugin (if not already installed)**

1. Go to **Jenkins Dashboard** → **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Plugins**.
2. Under the **Available** tab, search for:
   - **Throttle Concurrent Builds Plugin**
3. Check it and click **Install without restart**.

---

### 🛠️ **Step 2: Create the Freestyle Project**

1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard → **New Item**.
2. Enter the name: `Throttle build`.
3. Select **Freestyle project**.
4. Click **OK**.

### ⚙️ **Step 3: Configure Throttle Settings**

1. On the configuration page, scroll to **Build Environment**.
2. Check **“Throttle builds”**.
3. Configure the following:
   - **Throttle this project as part of one or more categories**:  
     - You can create a new category like `LimitedBuilds`.
     - Set **Maximum Total Concurrent Builds** (e.g., 2).
     - Set **Maximum Concurrent Builds Per Node** (e.g., 1).
   - Or, **Throttle this project alone**:
     - Set limits directly for this job.

> 📝 This ensures that only a limited number of builds run concurrently, either globally or per node.

---


### ✅ **Step 4: Save and Test**

1. Click **Save**.
2. Trigger multiple builds using **Build Now**.
3. Observe how Jenkins queues builds based on your throttle settings.


# Note :When you apply and save --> You can't run the builds beyond the number you've set in the specified timline
